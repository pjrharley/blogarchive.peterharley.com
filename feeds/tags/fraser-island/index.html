We were a little cheesed off with the camper company (Hippie Campers/Apollo) as when we booked it we hadn&amp;amp;#8217;t realised that unlike in New Zealand they insisted on taking the full excess on the insurance ($2500!) as a deposit, and it had to be on credit card. We couldn&amp;amp;#8217;t afford to do that on card of course so we were forced into upgrading the insurance to reduce the excess which was really extortionate. It meant paying less money on the day to have more insurance. The van isn&amp;amp;#8217;t as big as the previous one either which makes it a bit more cramped and more difficult to cook!
