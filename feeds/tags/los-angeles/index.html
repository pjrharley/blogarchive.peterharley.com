It&amp;amp;#8217;s our last night in LA, although we&amp;amp;#8217;ve got most of tomorrow here too. 
As planned we went to the Griffith Observatory on Saturday, up on the hills above LA. There was a lovely view across town but it was a little cloudy for photos! The observatory was good, there was a variety of sciency things there for Becky to not understand! We watched a couple of spacey shows there too, including a very cheesy demonstration of how to make your own comet. 
&lt;/p&gt;

First post while we&amp;amp;#8217;re away. We&amp;amp;#8217;ve been in LA for a few days now and have been reasonably busy.
We arrived at our hostel on Tuesday afternoon after an 11 hour flight at around half 5 in the evening (half 1 in the morning UK time!). The flight was OK, originally we weren&amp;amp;#8217;t seated together but BA managed to move us (twice!). There were some amazing views from the plane over Hudson Bay and other bits of Canada and the US too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
