We settled in to a hotel and had a catch up with them over dinner and a few drinks.
The next day we reserved for sightseeing, visiting the &amp;amp;#8216;Hanoi Hilton&amp;amp;#8217; prison, where they kept some American prisoners of war during the Vietnam (or as they call it, American) War. It was quite interesting, although, as to be expected, extremely biased. There was masses of information about how the Vietnamese were tortured and abused by the French during the colonial years, but when it came to the Americans they only had photos of them all looking happy having Christmas dinner!
