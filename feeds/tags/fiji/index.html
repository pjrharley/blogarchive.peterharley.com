Instead, when we arrived back on the mainland we followed a recommendation and headed north on the King&amp;amp;#8217;s Road by public bus to Rakiraki, staying at a resort called Volivoli. The King&amp;amp;#8217;s and Queen&amp;amp;#8217;s Roads are the two major roads in Fiji, but are still unsealed in parts and some of the bridges looked really quite dodgy - especially for such big buses!

Photos of the approach to the island don&amp;amp;#8217;t really do it justice as the sky looks a bit murky! We arrived and were shown to our beautiful beachfront bure (pronounced burr-ay) and settled in.

It&amp;amp;#8217;s our second day on the island of Ovalau today. We got up and were served a hearty breakfast by the lady who owns the Mavida Lodge (Papaya, banana and cereal, and then egg and sausages and toast!) before heading out to the Ovalau Watersports (Tourist info etc) to see if we could book a tour of some kind.
It turned out there weren&amp;amp;#8217;t any running, so one of the ladies there gave us a good description of where we could walk ourselves.

We eventually touched down around 11 hours later at 8.30am 15th April Fiji time and set about deciding where we were going to go!
With some help from a lady at the airport we got on a bus to Suva, the capital, and 4 long and sweaty hours later we arrived and checked into our hotel. Our plan was to go buy tickets to get a bus to Levuka the following day, but the bus had taken so long the office was closed. The hotel reception said it would be ok, we could get the bus, just go to the bus station at 4am to catch it&amp;amp;#8230;.
