We went for a walk around Lake Te Anau then stayed in a proper campsite there, charged things up and had a shower (luxury!). 
The following day we drove to Manipouri to catch our Doubtful Sound cruise. Doubtful is a little inaccessible - you take a boat across Lake Manipouri, which is in itself pretty impressive and takes about 45 minutes. That docks at the West Arm of the lake, where the hydroelectric power station is. From there a coach takes you over the Wilmot Pass road which was constructed for the power station and goes to Deep Cove on the sound. 
&lt;/p&gt;
