It was quite good fun, although I think a little bit less adventurous than Pete was hoping for! We jumped off quite a few waterfalls underground and cruised along the underwater passages on our tubes (big rubber rings) viewing the glow worms which live up on the roofs of the passages. After the trip we had a much needed hot shower and soup and bagels! It was quite good fun, although rather pricey, considering we can cave for free at home!

We stopped off there to do a short walk to the Devil&amp;amp;#8217;s Punchbowl waterfall.
On the east coast we headed towards Hanmer Springs, stopping overnight just south of it. The next day we went into the town and spent a couple of hours enjoying the hot geothermal waters. The pools ranged in temperature, from 38 degrees (hot) to 41 degrees (too hot!). The hotter ones were also unfiltered so smelt a bit sulphurous.

They also do the Nevis Bungy there, but we decided to go for the swing as it was cheaper for us both! It&amp;amp;#8217;s also the highest swing in the world, and you freefall 70m before swinging across the canyon.

We went for a walk around Lake Te Anau then stayed in a proper campsite there, charged things up and had a shower (luxury!). 
The following day we drove to Manipouri to catch our Doubtful Sound cruise. Doubtful is a little inaccessible - you take a boat across Lake Manipouri, which is in itself pretty impressive and takes about 45 minutes. That docks at the West Arm of the lake, where the hydroelectric power station is. From there a coach takes you over the Wilmot Pass road which was constructed for the power station and goes to Deep Cove on the sound.

We didn&amp;amp;#8217;t have anywhere booked for that night, but there&amp;amp;#8217;s a freephone in the airport you can use and some very helpful tourist info people. 
We got a free shuttle to the Kiwi Basecamp hostel that someone had recommended to us, it was nice, just like a big house converted into a hostel! We dumped our bags and went for a wander around the town which was only a short walk away.
