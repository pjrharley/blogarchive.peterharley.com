I wouldn’t have thought there’s any more around as in any major city! You’ll be fine if you stay in nice hotels/guesthouses, just look around rooms before you stay - prices start from $10! &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Comment on "Vietnam" by Alyson</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/blog/vietnam/?comment=eNxQmE5a#eNxQmE5a" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-09-10T12:55:20+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:8000/blog/vietnam/?comment=eNxQmE5a#eNxQmE5a</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, glad you are having such an interesting time.  I heard an absolute horror story from one of my friends, they had the most awful stay in Vietnam there was rats all over the place.  I really would like to go but am rat phobic, how did you find it?&lt;/p&gt;
