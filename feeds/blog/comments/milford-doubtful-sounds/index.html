Did you see much of the Marlborough ones? We only saw them from the ferry in the end but they were quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did visit the power station and I thought you’d find it all rather exciting! It was pretty cool actually.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Comment on "Milford and Doubtful Sounds" by Mike</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/blog/milford-doubtful-sounds/?comment=NCmgfMwl#NCmgfMwl" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-12T12:34:58+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:8000/blog/milford-doubtful-sounds/?comment=NCmgfMwl#NCmgfMwl</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yay!

Also - did you visit Manapouri power station, proudly operating Alstom turbines :-)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
